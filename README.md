# Embedded Reservoir Simulator
STM32 embedded system project developed in C for the NUCLEO-F401RE microcontroller using STM32CubeIDE. The system simulates a dynamic water reservoir by integrating a servo motor, DC pump motor, ultrasonic distance sensor, RPM sensor, and 7-segment display, all wired on a breadboard. Real-time system data such as water level and motor speed is transmitted via UART and monitored using PuTTY. A corresponding schematic and PCB layout were designed to support hardware integration and future PCB fabrication.
